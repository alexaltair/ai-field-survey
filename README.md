===============

Goal; to have a high- and mid-level overview of the entire field of AI in order to understand current trends, predict the future of the technology, and assess dangers.

Project Stages;
Gather data (highly parallelizable)
Organize the data (possibly into a database)
Understand the data, drawing inferences, policies or predictions (also parallelizable)
Write up a report

Major benefits;
We will learn 
* How many people are researching each type of method
* How much funding each method has
* Where experts’ opinions are
* What funders believe are good methods
* What students are being taught
This may give us a much better idea of timelines, safety concerns, and how to influence them.

Gather the following data;
List of AI methods & subfields
List of AI researchers
List of departments
List of projects
List of journals
Amounts of funding
University curricula

For example;

	Commercial project websites
	Call academics, department heads, project leaders, journal editors. Ask;
		What are the most important methods being researched? 
		What are the most promising projects or people?
		What are the most important journals/recent papers?

Organize the data;
Each data point has associations. A method or subfield has many researchers practicing it, many projects using it, many journals publishing it, et cetera. A project has many people working on it, uses a few methods, has a particular funding source, et cetera. The data does not seem to be simply organizable into a list, hierarchy, or matrix unless approximations are made (such as “a person can only work with one method”). Some custom XML formatting may be useful.
Data points can be associated with one of three categories; academic, government, or private. Amounts of funding should be recorded wherever available. Short descriptions of each data point along with all associations would be ideal.
With a sufficiently rigorous and well-planned database, statistics could be created. Of especial interest are numbers (like number of people working with a method, or number of projects with more than 20 people) or aggregate amounts of funding.
